📈 Explanation of the Graph
The graph shows how the expression 
(
1
+
1
𝑛
)
𝑛
(1+ 
n
1
​
 ) 
n
  behaves as 
𝑛
n (the number of compounding intervals per year) increases.

On the x-axis, we have the number of times interest is compounded in a year — from 1 (once a year) up to 1000 (very frequent compounding).

On the y-axis, we see the final amount after compounding ₹1 at 100% interest for 1 year.

As you can see:

When 
𝑛
n is small (like 1 or 2), the amount is low (₹2, ₹2.25, etc.).

As 
𝑛
n increases, the amount grows — but starts to level off.

It gradually approaches a limit — the number 
𝑒
≈
2.71828
e≈2.71828, shown as a red dashed line.

🔁 No matter how large 
𝑛
n gets, the curve never crosses 
𝑒
e — it just gets infinitely close.

🧠 Meaning:
This curve visually explains where the number 
𝑒
e comes from:

It is the maximum value you can reach by compounding 100% interest continuously over 1 year.

This concept is the foundation of natural logarithms and is deeply connected to many natural and physical processes, like growth, decay, and entropy.
